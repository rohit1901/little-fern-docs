# Programs
The programs are the main part of the website.
Currently, there are 7 programs available:
- Play Group
- Pre-Nursery
- Nursery
- Kindergarten
- Day Boarding
- Summer Adventure Camp
- Dance and Karate Fusion

Each of these programs are more or less similar to each other, but they are different in terms of the age group they cater to. The programs are designed to cater to the needs of children of different age groups. 
The programs are designed to be fun and engaging, and to help children develop their social, emotional, and cognitive skills.

The elements in each page to edit the programs are similar to other pages except for the following:
