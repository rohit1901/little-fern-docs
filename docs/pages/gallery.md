# Gallery page - Image Gallery
The gallery page is a collection of images that are displayed in a grid format. The images are displayed in a grid format with a title and description. 
The gallery page is designed to showcase the images in a visually appealing way and allow the user to view the images in full screen.

There is nothing special about the gallery page except:
- All images under the Gallery Items section have a Dropzone component for uploading images and a tag for filtering the image on the website.
