# Home Page
This guide will help you understand how to update the home page of [Little Fern](https://www.littlefern.in/)

## Important
Clicking the update button will only update the website with the new content. It will not update the images. 
To update the images, you need to upload the images using the dropzone.

## Collapsible Cards
The Home page, just like other pages, is divided into sections. Each section has a specific purpose and displays different types of content.
Each section is a collapsible card that can be expanded to view the content and collapsed to hide the content.
By default, all sections are open to display the content.

With the little arrow on the right side of the card, you can collapse or expand the card.

## Dropzone
A dropzone is a section where you can upload images. The dropzone is designed to help you manage the images on the website.
It has 4 main components:
- **Dropzone**: The area where you can drag and drop images to upload.
- **Image Preview**: The preview of the image that you have uploaded.
- **Upload Action**: The upload button that uploads the image to the website.
- **Preview link**: The link to either view on hover or click to open the image in a new tab.

**NOTE**: Just read the text on the dropzone and follow the instructions to upload the images.
